## Architecture

The app follows the modern layered architecture recommended by Google. The UI layer observes
immutable state from ViewModels. Business logic is encapsulated in use case classes within the
domain layer, which interact with repositories in the data layer. Each screen now exposes its
operations through a small set of use cases. This pattern was inspired by the
[Android Clean Architecture](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture) sample but
implemented in a simplified form to avoid adding heavy dependencies. The result keeps the UI
simple and ensures a clear separation of concerns across the whole app.
